# rfiddoorlocksystem

So In this project i showed how you can make your very own automatic smart door locking system using Arduino and Rfid sensor. This works in a very simple way whenever you bring your RFID card near to the RFID sensor it will automatically detect the UID (unique identification number) of the card and it will give access to the door and it will open the lock if you try with some other RFID card then it will deny your entry and the buzzer will start shooting.
